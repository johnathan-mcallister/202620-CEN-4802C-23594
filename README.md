## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of a recursive method to calculate the expected value in a Fibonacci sequence based on a given starting position.

## System Requirements/Constraints
* A recursive static method that returns the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence
* The method should accept n as a parameter
* A main method that calls the first method
* Output the 10th term of the Fibonacci sequence along with some descriptive text, e.g. "The nth term of the Fibonacci sequence is y."
